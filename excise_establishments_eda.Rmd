```{r eda_bar_plot}

# maybe neighborhood name?
stl_excise_establishments %>% 
  count(neighborhood_name, sort = TRUE)

stl_excise_establishments %>% 
  filter(!is.na(neighborhood_name)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(neighborhood_name, fill = status_code)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()

# status code
stl_excise_establishments %>% 
  count(status_code)

stl_excise_establishments %>% 
  ggplot(aes(status_code)) +
  geom_bar()
```
Bar plot this, multi-select (?) for neighborhoods of interest


```{r eda_histogram}
stl_excise_establishments %>% 
  glimpse()

stl_excise_establishments %>% 
  ggplot(aes(police_district_when_last_updated)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
